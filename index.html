   <p>
  OBH has a reality game show called the Dating Game where the host, SmartPants, instructs a 
group of novices on the finer points of socializing. On one particular episode, SmartPants
brings the group into a club. The goal of each Contestant is to get phone numbers from
potential Dates at the club. He has num_rounds to do so.
Three types of threads:
SmartPants
Contestant
Date
Each Contestant arrives at the club on his own (simulated by sleep(random time)). When the 
Contestant arrives, he has to meet SmartPants. Contestant will do busy waiting until 
SmartPants lets him know that he is available to meet. SmartPants will talk to each Contestant 
in FCFS order (you can use a Boolean array/vector, queue like structure in order to enforce the 
order).
After the initiation, Contestants enter the club to meet a Date. If there is no Date available, the 
Contestant will kill some time at the Juice Bar (use yield( ) and after sleep(random time)).
